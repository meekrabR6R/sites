My name is Nick Miano. I'm a programmer. I love building software to solve interesting problems. I write code for work, and I write code for fun. I'm pretty obsessive about it.

I also love (human) languages. I'm a native English speaker, but I also speak Spanish, am learning Portuguese, and know a little Italian. Linguistics is a growing interest of mine.

I'm very interested in deep neural networks and natural language processing.

Feel free to reach out! I love hearing from people who are working on interesting problems. :)
